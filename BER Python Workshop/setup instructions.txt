1. Download Python 3.7.1 (latest release)
https://www.python.org/downloads/ (windows)
https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/ (mac)
2. Install Anaconda.
https://www.anaconda.com/download/
(follow instructions for windows/mac/linux)
All relevant packages/libraries for workshop are downloaded 
as part of Anaconda.

3. Inside Anaconda, install jupyter notebook. 
This will be our environment for the workshop. It's more usable
than a traditional text editor because it's interactive and
you can test portions of code instead of all at once.
