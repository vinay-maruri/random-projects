set of assumptions: 
1. Because the typical family size is 2.54 people, living wage data displayed is for a 2 adult, 1 child family. 
2. Because the California HHS dataset (ca-livingwage.csv) assumes this type of family has one worker; the living
wage is what one worker would need to make per hour in that county. 
3. This data was all taken from the MIT Living Wage Calculator. Their definition of a living wage is:
"a 'step up' from poverty as measured by the poverty thresholds". It accounts for the basic needs of a family.
It is the minimum subsistence wage for persons living in the United States. (no need for public assistance
and no severe housing + food insecurity)
